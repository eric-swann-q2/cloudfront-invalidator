# AWS-CloudFront-Invalidator 
Forked from cloudfront-invalidator
A command line tool that invalidates the cache of a web hosting CloudFront distribution by providing a S3 Bucket name. 
### Installing

install globally via npm:

```
npm i -g aws-cloudfront-invalidator
```

### Usage

This program will assume the AWS region to be defined as a global variable.  

If the region is not defined as a global variable, then it will retrieve the region from the ~/.aws/credentials  or the ~/.aws/config. 

You can read more about how the aws-sdk handles the region [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-region.html#setting-region-order-of-precedence)

Easiest way to switch/modify the region would be to set the AWS_REGION global variable

~~~
export AWS_REGION=<your region>
// example:
export AWS_REGION=us-west-2
~~~

Examples: 

~~~bash
cloudfront-invalidator -b [s3 bucket name]
~~~
